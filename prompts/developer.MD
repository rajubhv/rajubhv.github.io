Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Let’s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

Here’s the idea:

<IDEA>

#########

index=* step=HttpClient 
| spath input=_raw path=requestPayload.messages{0}.content output=request_content
| spath input=_raw output=response_json path=responsePayload
| stats 
    first(request_content) as request_message 
    first(response_json) as responsePayload 
    first(timestamp) as request_time
    last(timestamp) as response_time
    by requestId
| where isnotnull(request_message) AND isnotnull(responsePayload)
| rex field=responsePayload mode=sed "s/\",\"/\",\n\"/g"
| rex field=responsePayload mode=sed "s/\{/\{\n/g"
| rex field=responsePayload mode=sed "s/\}/\n\}/g"
| rex field=responsePayload mode=sed "s/\[/\[\n/g"
| rex field=responsePayload mode=sed "s/\]/\n\]/g"
| table requestId, request_message, responsePayload, request_time, response_time
